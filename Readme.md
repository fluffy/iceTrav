# draft-jennings-behave-rtcweb-firewall

* [Editor's copy](https://fluffy.github.io/iceTrav/)
* [Working Group Draft] (https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-jennings-behave-rtcweb-firewall)


## Contributing

Be aware that all contributions to the specification fall under the "NOTE WELL"
terms outlined below.


## Building the Draft

Formatted text and HTML versions of the draft can be built using `make`.

```sh
$ make
```

This requires that you have the necessary software installed.  There are several
other tools that are enabled by make, check the Makefile for details, including
links to the software those tools might require.


## Installation and Setup

Mac users will need to install
[XCode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835) to get `make`, see
[this answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/11494872/1375574) for instructions.
Some of the makefile targets need GNU make 4.0, which Apple doesn't ship yet;
sorry, but if you want those, you can
[download](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) and build a copy for yourself.

Windows users will need to use [Cygwin](http://cygwin.org/) to get `make`.

All systems require [xml2rfc](http://xml2rfc.ietf.org/).  This requires [Python
2.7](https://www.python.org/).  The easiest way to get `xml2rfc` is with `pip`.

Using a `virtualenv`:

```sh
$ virtualenv --no-site-packages venv
# remember also to activate the virtualenv before any 'make' run
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install xml2rfc
```

To your local user account:

```sh
$ pip install --user xml2rfc
```

Or globally:

```sh
$ sudo pip install xml2rfc
```

xml2rfc depends on development versions of [libxml2](http://xmlsoft.org/) and
[libxslt1](http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT).  These packages are named `libxml2-dev` and
`libxslt1-dev` (Debian, Ubuntu) or `libxml2-devel` and `libxslt1-devel` (RedHat,
Fedora).

If you use markdown, you will also need to install `kramdown-xml2rfc`, which
requires Ruby and can be installed using the roby package manager, `gem`:

```sh
$ gem install kramdown-xml2rfc
```
